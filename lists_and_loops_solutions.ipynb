    "### 1. Slicing Strings\n",
    "A section of a list is called a slice. We can take slices of character strings as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "element = 'oxygen'\n",
    "print('first three characters:', element[0:3])\n",
    "print('last three characters:', element[3:6])\n",
    "first three characters: oxy\n",
    "last three characters: gen\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the value of `element[:4]`? What about `element[4:]`? Or `element[:]`?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is `element[-1]`? What is `element[-2]`?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given those answers, explain what `element[1:-1]` returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How can we rewrite the slice for getting the last three characters of element, so that it works even if we assign a different string to element? Test your solution with the following strings: `carpentry`, `clone`, `hi`.\n",

    "### 2. Identifying Variable Name Errors\n",
    "1. Read the code below, and (without running it) try to identify what the errors are.\n",
    "1. Run the code, and read the error message. What type of `NameError` do you think this is? In other words, is it a string with no quotes, a misspelled variable, or a variable that should have been defined but was not?\n",
