    "### 1. Combining Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "“Adding” two strings produces their concatenation: `'a' + 'b'` is `'ab'`. Write a function called `fence` that takes two parameters called `original` and `wrapper` and returns a new string that has the `wrapper` character at the beginning and end of `original`. A call to your function should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(fence('name', '*'))\n",

    "Output:\n",
    "```python\n",

    "### 2. Return versus print\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `return` and `print` are not interchangeable. `print` is a Python function that prints data to the screen. It enables us, users, see the data. The `return` statement, on the other hand, makes data visible to the program. Let’s have a look at the following function:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "A = add(7, 3)\n",
    "print(A)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Python will first execute the function add with `a = 7` and `b = 3`, and, therefore, print `10`. However, because the function `add` does not have a line that starts with `return` (no `return` “statement”), it will, by default, return nothing which, in the Python world, is called `None`. Therefore, `A` will be assigned to `None` and the last line, `print(A)`, will print `None`. As a result, we will see:\n",

    "### 3. Selecting Characters From Strings\n",
    "If the variable `s` refers to a string, then `s[0]` is the string’s first character and `s[-1]` is its last. Write a function called `outer` that returns a string made up of just the first and last characters of its input. A call to your function should look like this:\n",

    "Attempting to define the `numbers` function results in `4. SyntaxError`. The defined parameters `two` and `four` are given default values.

    "1. 3 3\n",
    "1. 7 7\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "`3 7` is the correct answer. Initially, `a` has a value of `3` and `b` has a value of `7`. When the `swap` function is called, it creates local variables (also called `a` and `b` in this case) and trades their values. The function does not return any values and does not alter `a` or `b` outside of its local copy. Therefore the original values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged."
