    "\n",
    "- Understand that a list in Python is an ordered data structure, whose elements can be accessed via indexes.\n",
    "- Understand the importance of whitespace in Python.\n",
    "- Write scripts that use `for` loops to iterate over lists and character strings.\n",
    "- Write scripts that use `if/elif/else` to perform conditional operations.\n",
    "- Call built-in functions.\n",
    "- Call methods on strings and lists.\n",
    "- Use online help to inspect functions' documenatation.\n",
    "- Use `range`and `for` to iterate over a sequence of numbers.\n",
    "- Correctly write programs that use `if`and `else` statements and simple Boolean expressions (without logical operators).\n",
    "- Trace the execution of unnested conditionals and conditionals inside loops.\n",
